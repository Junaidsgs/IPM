# Impression Prediction Model / Impression Forcast Model

## Problem Statement:

To develop a time-series regression model that predicts the number of downloads for an application on day T, given a feature vector X representing the preceding n days of historical data.

## Proposed Methodology:
### Models :
Linear Regression, LSTM and Facebook’s Prophet Model. We will investigate other models as well like ARIMA, ARDL and different LSTM variations

### Validation:
Using Existing past data we will check our model’s accuracy using MAE, MSE, Huber Loss and other time series based evaluation Metrics

### Evaluation Plans:
We will evaluate each of the models we build and compare them with each other.
